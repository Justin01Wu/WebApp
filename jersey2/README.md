# API tips

## General rules:
+ To make RESTful developer friendly, url should explain itself well
+ Path parameter should be always be Integer and a kind of PK,  its prefix noun tell the meaning:
	+ good example: /students/{studentId}/courses/{courseId}
	+ bad example: /students/{studentId}/{courseId}
	+ bad example: /students/{courseId}
+ Please use symmetric rule(mirror rule) when a java Object is used on input and output API:
	+ Ie. GET should return exact data structure of PUT and POST input
	+ output json can directly used for input json	
	+ But some fields should be read only: like createdTime, updatedBy, pk, ï¿½
+ Try to make JSON structure flat
	+ If it has too many layers, it usually mean you have some design issue on API 
	+ and will make JAVA code difficult because it is usually on JAVA object reflection, which need more useless Java Class.
	
## Foreign key
+ To make RESTful simple, we don't add reference object in API, we only return foreign key itself.
+ UI side use another API to get details if they need.
+ If the result is a list, we can also call the second API for foreign key list.
	+ For example:
	+ The program has clientId, Then API to get program or programList only return clientId itself
	+ If UI side wants to display client name, then it needs to call  clients/51,1023 to get those client information
	
## Testing

+ Sometimes, we can add extra fields or api for troubleshooting or integration testing, for example: 
	+ You can add sequence Id or updated date to test if a record was updated properly in previous step
+ Integration test: 
	+ for HTTP GET, it is easy, because you connect the system to prod Db copy. 
	+ But sometimes it is hard to prepare good data for post and put. So we can add a test flag on it: if it is true, we skip or roll back real job on server side. 
	+ In this way, it can test most of function without change the real data.
	+ It means the test cases can run for ever on the same data.


## Verify API Interface
+ Most of APIs are using reflection of Java object to generate json structure. 
+ Sometimes we don't know if it's field name is changed.
	+ specially it is extended or deeply embedded in the parent class.
+ So we need to test if json structure is silently changed or not, which is most dangerous thing on Jackson.
+ We can use Integration test to test if json structure is silently changed or not.
+ We can also use Jackson ObjectMapper to verify if Java class structure is aligned with a Json structure:
```
    	ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();    	
        String origJsonDataFile = UserExtTest.class.getSimpleName() + ".json";
        String templateData = ApiTestUtil.readJSONFile(origJsonDataFile);
        UserExt dto = mapper.readValue(templateData, UserExt.class);        
       	assertNull( dto.getId());
        String targetJson = mapper.writeValueAsString(dto);        
        JSONObject json = ApiTestUtil.convertJSONStr2Obj(targetJson);
        JSONObject expectedJson = ApiTestUtil.convertJSONStr2Obj(templateData);
        ApiTestUtil.verifyJson((Map<String, Object>)json, (Map<String, Object>)expectedJson);
```	
		
## Jackson
Jackson is the main framework for Java Object Json mapping, So we discuss mainly on it:

+ @JsonIgnore can't be overwrote, sub class has to use another method to get it back:	        
```
    @JsonProperty("categoryId")
    public Integer getCategoryId2() {
        return super.getCategoryId();
    }
```
+ Enum by default uses literal value, it is good enough for most of case:
	+ `Public enum ContractStatusEnum{ Quote(10); ...}` will return 'Quoted' in API
	+So you don't need to do anything for it.

+ Sometimes, it is hard to reflect on Java object, then we can use flexible json:
	+ UI using JSON.stringfy convert json into a string, then save a whole json string into a field in a table, most of DB can do it, like MS SQL have nvarchar(max), it can save 2G data into it.
	+ API can direct return a json String or input a json string on a field:
	+ raw json string: return "{\"id\":\""+id+"\"}";
	+ return map: map.put("id", 1223); map.put("name", "Justin"); map can be nested.
